## Mahout Collaborative 

Implementation of collaborative filtering using ALS factorizer

## Data 

We used the dataset from http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ which has the following format:

User, Movie, Rank

## Execution

To run the program you just need to use the scripts named activator on the root of this project,
using the parameter run.

example:

./activator run

It might take some time the first time you run because it will download all the dependencies nedded.
